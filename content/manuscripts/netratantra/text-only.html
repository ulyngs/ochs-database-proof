Homage to Śiva, the supreme Lord of the Universe [beginning with] Brahma, who is threefold, the possessor of power, having taken form in three states, he performs the entire arising, maintenance, and destruction of the universe from his power, whose nature is full of the pure nectar [of immortality], the supreme self.<\/div>","<div>1.3-4ab. Parvatī, with desire for the welfare of living beings, having seen the delighted god seated on the peak of Mount Kailasa, God of Gods, the Great Lord, the Destroyer, together with Parvatī, and playing with the host [of supernatural beings], rose quickly from his lap and grasped his feet. Having satis ed the Supreme Lord with supreme devotion she asked: The Goddess spoke:<\/div>","<div>1.4cd-9. O Lord, Lord of the God of Gods, Lord of the Worlds, Lord of the Universe, you create a great wonder that generates astonishment, O God of the entire universe, my own Supreme Lord. It is diﬃcult to know, diﬃcult to attain, secret, not illuminated for Kārt- tikeya, nor for me, nor among the gods or hosts, nor for the Lords of Yoga, the Mothers, the Sages, [and] Yogis. O Lord, if you are very pleased with me today, O Lord of the Universe, I, humbled, ask that you tell me [about it] fully. So having heard the speech of the Goddess, the one with a pleased countenance spoke: The Lord spoke:<\/div>","<div>1.10. Whatever the secret in your heart, O one with excellent hips, [which] you speak of, I shall certainly explain all to you, [because I am] content with you, O sinless one. The Goddess spoke:<\/div>","<div>1.11. Lord, Lord of the God of Gods, I would hear about such delightful wonder, exhibiting various wonders, not [previously] heard.<\/div>","<div>1.12. O Master with a pleased countenance who causes supreme bliss, O Lord, tell me this without displeasure.<\/div>","<div>1.13. O God, whatever consists of water is the eye seen everywhere, so how can re that burns time have arisen from it, O ferocious one?<\/div>","<div>1.14. Kāma was completely turned to ash by merely being seen by it. 1 What is that ferocious re produced, O God, by the desire to look at time? 2<\/div>","<div>1.15. [That re] has ignited the entire universe beginning from [the world of] Brahma to the plant [world]. Desire itself is burned easily, O Supreme Lord, in the same manner<\/div>","<div>1.16. O Lord, thus the re of the angry eye is cause of the great wonder created by the God of Gods, which is seen by no one at all.<\/div>","<div>1.17. For, O God, who can see [this] re within the eye except you? Or why is the eye made of re? How does it not come about?<\/div>","<div>1.18. By the eye which is completely full of nectar, you instantly cause the whole world to prosper [which is] expanding, O Lord of the Universe.<\/div>","<div>1.19. You cause bliss to me, O God, with [your] delighted eye. Like the appearance of nectar, [the eye] is radiant and a cause of prosperity in the world.<\/div>","<div>1.20. Therefore how is this re, which extends as the re of time, produced? Can you fully explain all this, O Lord? The Lord spoke:<\/div>","<div>1.21-22. Possessed of great curiosity, you ask about this, [so] listen, O Dear One. I will tell you about all that which is the re in the eye and which is supreme nectar, O dear one, listen attentively3 about that which is the innate essence, pure, pervading, facing in all directions.<\/div>","<div>1.23. [It is] located within all beings, the life in all breathing things, attained with practice, [but] diﬃcult to reach [and] hard to attain by unrestrained souls.<\/div>","<div>1.24. [It is] truly my supreme abode, my own virile power and my own object of knowledge. That virile power of all virile powers is the strength of the strong.<\/div>","<div>1.25. It is the splendour of splendours, the all, eternal, unmoving [and] rm. [That energy] is the Supreme Power, my [power of] will,controlled, born from [my] own nature.<\/div>","<div>1.26. As heat from re and rays from sun are known [to be inseparable], even so my own Power, the cause of the entire universe [is inseparable from me].<\/div>","<div>1.27. In her are the qualities of omniscience and so on, the manifest and unmanifest are es- tablished [in her]. She has will and knowledge, possessed of the qualities of action and so on.<\/div>","<div>1.28. The six qualities beginning with knowledge4 are located in her, for she is established as the great form of action, the one action, the mother.<\/div>","<div>1.29. She creates [and] destroys the eight supernatural abilities beginning with [the power] to make oneself small, in this way my power called will, knowledge and action is expressed.<\/div>","<div>1.30. Imagining the three eyes is imagining of the three luminosities [that comprise] re, sun and moon, perceived here for me as having the same purpose.<\/div>","<div>1.31. By means of that I bestow the burning [of time and desire], prosperity [of the world],5 [and] illumination, I who have a [threefold] body6 bestow creation, maintenance, and de- struction.<\/div>","<div>1.32. All that [universe] is lled up with power, enlarged by my lustre, whose nature is will, knowledge and action, which is the supreme nectar of my eye.<\/div>","<div>1.33. That power is the supreme place, which is the nature of supreme nectar. This is that great joy and that is the supreme foundation in the body.<\/div>","<div>1.34. This is that which is knowledge without aspect, pure, the supreme eye. Because of that, it is named the Conqueror of Death; it bestows liberation for all.<\/div>","<div>1.35. That [eye] bestows supreme success, O Goddess, it bestows freedom from all suﬀering, destroys all sickness [and] destroys all disease, [one should praise] the auspicious god.<\/div>","<div>1.36. It subdues poverty, is eternal, the conqueror of death, facing everywhere, never fruit- less, pure, tranquil, all-pervading, [and] established in everything.<\/div>","<div>1.37. Countless thousands of ames of countless millions of suns are not equal to a sixteenth part of that splendour.<\/div>","<div>1.38. [The eye] is full of lustre therefore it cannot be controlled by gods and demons, I [can] de nitely burn everything in an instant with the re of that eye.<\/div>","<div>1.39. I bestow great satisfaction and illumination by it, therefore beyond it no other energy can be seen [to supersede it].<\/div>","<div>1.40. That very [eye] is the weapon, ferocious, being the supreme refuge of the soul. This weapon destroys all enemies, it is declared to be the weapon.<\/div>","<div>1.41. That weapon gives long life to all beings, that one abundant energy is extended by an in nity of divisions.<\/div>","<div>1.42. For me [the weapon is] the Great Pāśupata [mantra], while for Viṣṇu it is Sudarśana, for Brahmā it is the staﬀ of Brahmā; everyone has their own weapon.<\/div>","<div>1.43. That weapon [is manifested] through numerous forms and in various ways, its energy expressed by me, the essence of the gods.<\/div>","<div>1.44. This universe is pervaded by the Goddess of Yoga, the energy of knowledge. She is the supreme protector from fears and frights, the ultimate safety.<\/div>","<div>1.45. [She is] de nitely the supreme bestower of liberation for those aﬄicted by enemies. What is the point of frequent repetition spoken exhaustively, O beautiful one?<\/div>","<div>1.46. Whatever is the sharpest, ferocious, glorious power, that alone is the very best, boon- giving favour, the illumination.<\/div>","<div>1.47. That [eye] is the object of knowledge and immeasurable knowledge, the mantra, the great power, the salvation of all beings, the secret, always to be hidden by me.<\/div>","<div>1.48. Today [I have] told this to you, O Goddess, what more will you ask? Here ends the rst chapter concerning the authority of the decent of the Tantra, accord- ing to the rule of the immortal Conqueror of Death, which is the essence of the collection of all the streams of revelation.<\/div>","<div>The Goddess spoke: 2.1. If [this be] so,1 your supreme virtue is tranquil, immeasurable, endowed with [all good] qualities and gives favour to all. This has been heard from your mouth, O God.<\/div>","<div>2.2. O Lord, Lord of the God of Gods, O cause of benevolence for the world, all this derives from three sources, [namely] gods, men, and perfected ones.<\/div>","<div>2. 3-4. Terri ed by fear of disease and mental agony, aﬄicted by fear of the poison-ghosts, surrounded by hundreds of dangers, aﬄicted by fever, coughing and consumption, [these] living beings beginning with Brahmins, in the sky, atmosphere and in the human world, full of hundreds of transgressions and suﬀering, from where does their happiness arise, O Lord?<\/div>","<div>2.5. Those endowed with strength, who are strong [because] they have been swollen by your energy and strength desire to destroy their life because of their own arrogance correspond- ing to [this degenerate] age.<\/div>","<div>2.6-7. For the sake of favouring them out of compassion for the welfare of living beings, op- pressed by many hundred diﬀerent diseases, [tell us] the method, O Lord of the Universe, by which all are freed, whatever the method [be it] knowledge, yoga or mantra.2<\/div>","<div>2.8. Whatever you see,3 O Lord of Gods, tell me that method, O Soul. So, having heard the Goddess, Śiva, laughing, said:<\/div>","<div>2.9. The Lord spoke: You are lled with great curiosity, O Goddess, [what] you ask me, nobody has asked me [before and] I have not made this known to anybody.<\/div>","<div>2.10. Among all eyes, the reality of the eye has been proclaimed, [but] on my part, nobody has de ned it because of the diﬃculties in attaining it.4<\/div>","<div>2.11. Today I will tell you about the threefold method [which is] de nitely the best; it bestows the best supernatural ability [and] liberation, to be attained by mantra, yoga, and knowl- edge.<\/div>","<div>2.12. I speak about that which is made of mantra, which possesses a threefold perfection, complete, associated with its own seal, the supreme, that protects all.<\/div>","<div>2.13-16. If they are marked by Bhūtas, Yakṣas, Grahas, Unmādas, Śākiṇis, Yoginīs, Gaṇas, Bhaginīs, Rudramātṛs etc., Ḍāvīs (Ḍāvyas), Ḍāmarikas, by Rūpikas, Apasmaras, Piśācas, and also others, Brahmarakṣas and millions of Ugrahas, [then] kings, princes, and queens are repeatedly aﬄicted by sudden death and killed by the snares of time [along with] all living beings beginning with Brahmins, aﬄicted by all [kinds of] faults and fears. They are freed by simply remembering what I am [about] to tell you.<\/div>","<div>2.17-18. In a pure and even place, smeared with [a preparation of] aloe wood and sandal [oils], infused with the fragrant scent of camphor, smeared with the perfume of saﬀron, the great minded teacher is joyful, smeared with aloe and sandal, and adorned by ornaments, turbans5 and so on.<\/div>","<div>2.19. Having made a lotus of eight petals, he should write the alphabet there. Having xed the [sign for] OṂ in the middle, he should write the letters beginning from the east.6<\/div>","<div>2.20. He should worship with highest devotion and with a multitude of oﬀerings [such as] owers, fragrant powders, and holy water. He should place [there], O Goddess, the mantra deity, the supreme mantra, the mother of mantras.<\/div>","<div>2.21-22. One should join together the light that is the supreme power of sound with Śiva; beginning with the universal (i.e. the syllable A), ending with various letters [and] in every case completed with a cresent moon7 and nectar (i.e. the point or anusvāra). With that [syl- lable OṂ], all [letters] are strung together like a series of jewels on a thread; from it, Mantras for the quali ed [practitioner] of seventy million [kinds] have arisen.8<\/div>","<div>2.23. Following the place belonging to re [i.e. the South-East and so the South] is the belly which is like the half moon [i.e. JA], placed above the goad [i.e. the syllable U], which is connected above that at the end of the [group of ] wind-letters [in the north-west, i.e. MA].9<\/div>","<div>2.24. Whatever is the highest light, that is the supreme nectar [i.e. the syllable SA], that is taught as supreme, the nectar renowned in the world.<\/div>","<div>2.25. United with the power of nectar [i.e. the visarga Ḥ]10 it resembles the lustre of the full moon. It is the highest light, it is the highest place.<\/div>","<div>2.26. It is his supreme power, it is his highest nectar, the highest brilliance of brilliances, the supreme light of lights.<\/div>","<div>2.27. The god of the entire universe is the Lord, the de nite cause, the creator, maker, and destroyer, no one has the strength of the world.11<\/div>","<div>2.28. [The eye is] the basis of mantras for [it is] the abode of all supernatural powers and virtues. I will now tell you about the ancillary mantras [and the ritual] preparation by which [the practitioner] achieves success.<\/div>","<div>2.29. Situated on the southern petal [the group beginning with CA] is the middle syllable [of that group, namely JA], followed by the fth [letter in the group of] the king of sounds [namely U]. The head is the nal in the wind [group, namely MA or the anusvāra]. [This is the second seed syllable which is rendered as] the heart located in all [beings].12<\/div>","<div>2.30. This is the [formation of the] head [mantra]: the end of the moon [category, i.e. the syllable VA] is connected with the re [category, the syllable YA, and] connected with the OṂ. The tuft is known as illusion [the syllable I] united with the end of the air [category, the syllable M].13<\/div>","<div>2.31. At the end of the calm, above the Lord [category, the syllable KŚA, is the syllable HA]. It is joined with the sixth [letter Ū]. [Along with] the resonance connected with Śiva and Śakti [the nasal Ṃ], it is the supreme armour [HŪṂ].<\/div>","<div>2.32. Along with the rst of Bhairava [the syllable JA] and situated on the head of the wind [which is the syllable YA] is OṂ. [This is the very ferocious eye mantra [of the eye] which destroys all sins.<\/div>","<div>2.33. This weapon mantra is declared to be the syllable PHA united with ṬA.14 This sixfold [set] of components of the king of mantras had been proclaimed [and] unsheathed.15 Thus [is completed] the second chapter about the injunction of raising the mantra of Mṛ- tyuñjaya, the rule of the Lord of Immortality, the essence of the group of all streams [of revelation].<\/div>","<div>The Lord spoke: 3.1-2. Now I will tell [you] about the worship by which the king of mantras succeeds. First [the practitioner] bathes for the destruction of all sin. O Goddess, extracting clay with the weapon mantra, after doing the prescribed puri cation, the knower of mantra then begins bathing.<\/div>","<div>3.3. First [he adorns] his feet with clay, shanks, buttocks, and thighs three times three; the mind is puri ed by the inner practice with three times seven [mantra repetitions].<\/div>","<div>3.4. Kneading the clay, consecrating it seven times with the weapon mantra, after warming it in the sun, the knower of mantras should anoint his body.<\/div>","<div>3. 5. Having washed the body to remove obstacles, he should mutter the water mantra, then he should make three clay portions in the left hand.<\/div>","<div>3.6. He should throw [the clay, which] was muttered over with the weapon mantra, to the directions, [and] he should imagine the crossing point as the root mantra. After writing on the body with the auxiliary mantras [and] having thrown [water] he should mutter the water mantra.<\/div>","<div>3.7. [The practitioner] should praise the root [mantra] in the rites at the junctures of the day, having brought it forth with power in due order. After binding his hair in a top knot, recalling the top knot [he should perform] the puri cation of the mantras.<\/div>","<div>3.8 . Having satis ed the gods, ancestors, sages, and men along with the demons, abiding at the threshold,1 he should enter the sanctum in accordance with the rule.<\/div>","<div>3.9. He should make oﬀering to the mothers in the [outer] directions, Gaṇapati and Lakṣmī [above the door] and Nandin and Gaṅgā [on the right]. Then he should worship Mahākāla [and] Yamunā [on the left] doorpost.<\/div>","<div>3.10-11. After removing the ghosts with the weapon mantra 2 [and] sealing the directions with the armour mantra [preventing their re-entry], sitting down facing east3 and visualis- ing the support power as his own throne, he should perform breath control in due order. He should concentrate on that place [at the support power of the earth] together with wind and so on4<\/div>","<div>3.12. There he should meditate the sealing of the quarters, [imagining] impurity as six sheaths [in the body]. There he should meditate consciousness only that pervades [objects which are] empty.<\/div>","<div>3.13. He proclaims here, ‘I do not exist and no other exists' which ought to be meditated upon; dissolving in a state of joy, the mind has entered into the sameness of avour [with the Lord].<\/div>","<div>3.14 Afterwards he should meditate on his own throne as the place of the support power, the earth, the ocean of milk, the lotus, the shining image of the moon.<\/div>","<div>3.15. After [the puri cation of the body] he should visualise the series of phases of the rising moon, sprinkled with nectar [along with] the eastern image, in the three realities with the root [mantra].5<\/div>","<div>3.16. Then he should x the ancillary [mantras] on the body with both hands once more. With the practice of concentration he should meditate the mantra [that gives him] a sense of self presence.6<\/div>","<div>3.17.-20. Having assumed the cow gesture or also the lotus gesture, he should meditate on the Lord of gods in the self, having equal splendour to ten million moons, resembling the fruit released from a jujube tree, having equal splendour to camphor, like jasmine, the moon, and cow’s milk, resembling a [crystal] mountain, adorned with white ornaments with sandal, delightful camphor, saﬀron and so on, with limbs smeared with white sandal, powdered, grey camphor, submerged by many wide waves of nectar from the throbbing moon, situated in the middle of the lunar disc, single faced with three eyes.<\/div>","<div>3.21.-23. And seated on a white lotus [he is] established and xed on the lotus throne, ra- diant like the full moon, having four arms, with bulging eyes, whose hands bear the boon giving and protection gestures, holding [in his right hand] a pot lled with nectar, making full the entire universe. Then [the practitioner] should visualise in his left hand a full moon. He should meditate on him [to be] revered with worship that is entirely white.<\/div>","<div>3.24. What need is there of much talk regarding this? He directly perceives the ocean of nectar, from which nectar is produced, vivifying for all.<\/div>","<div>3.25. So he should meditate upon [the deity] according to the division of its nature, as the wish-ful lling gem [allows] , distinguished by its nature as gentle, savage, fearful, [or] de- formed.<\/div>","<div>3.25.-28. [Those forms are] Sadāśiva, Bhairava, Tumburu, and Vīranayaka. Then what- ever form the practitioner meditates upon, he goes to that; the Lord [attained], as it were, through the wish ful lling gem.7 Having thus visualised [the deity] in this way, he should worship the god with beautiful, mental owers in the lotus of the heart for the purpose of all accomplishments. After that he should worship externally. The pure, mental icon is [wor- shipped] with mental owers by the practitioner.<\/div>","<div>3.29. [This mental icon] without impurity, supremely pure, auspicious, bestows libera- tion, [and] bestows magical powers, therefore with every continued eﬀort, determinedly the mental worship [is to be performed].<\/div>","<div>3.30.-31ab. Then after [mental worship] this [external worship] is to be performed with var- ious substances, in one's own house, meeting in a temple, at the top of a mountain, with praise, on a part of the earth, in a splendid thicket of lotuses.<\/div>","<div>3.31cd-33. He should draw a ritual diagram decorated with white lines, four doors, four equal corners, gratifying, possessed of brilliance upon brilliance, with the circle of the moon in the middle of it, like a full moon consisting of a garland row of moonbeams, with a lotus of eight petals in the middle of that, white like the moon.<\/div>","<div>3.34. Uppermost is the golden pericarp having variegated laments and into the middle of that he should make the Lord of gods descend from his own place.<\/div>","<div>3.35. Then he should invite the god imagined with three bodies.<\/div>","<div>3.36. He should x the ancillary mantras on the petals beginning with the south-eastern quarter. [The Lord is] to be worshipped with white oﬀerings, with ungents from the per- fume of owers.<\/div>","<div>3.37. He should worship [the deity] according to the distinction of its nature, with food oﬀer- ings of various kinds, with well perfumed diﬀerent kinds of best incense, and with various pleasant drinks.<\/div>","<div>3.38. O beloved, he should worship for the purpose of appeasement with entirely white substances; he should make oﬀerings to the sancti ed [icon] for the purpose of prosperity, with many mixed materials brought together.<\/div>","<div>3.39. Afterwards he should perform the re sacri ce according to prescribed ritual [in the re pit which is], round and square, beautiful, with three encircling steps.8<\/div>","<div>3.40-41. So [he should make the re] pot a hand's measure [deep], with an upper step mea- suring six ngers, the middle of eight, and the lower of twelve ngers, thus the pit is a hand's measure, eight and one nger. The navel [of the re pit] resembling a banyan tree leaf, he should make nine ngers [deep].<\/div>","<div>3.42. [The re altar] is three ngers from top to middle, like that from length to side. It is declared [that it should be suﬃcient] for the thousandfold re oﬀering and [should have] a double quality understood [to be suﬃcient] in [the ten thousandfold] sacri ce.9<\/div>","<div>3.43. The fteenfold sacri ce is considered as having a threefold quality. The re pit, pos- sessing that quality, is truly praised in the ten-thousand sacri ce.<\/div>","<div>3.44. The re-pit [is to be praised] in [the purpose of] daily and occasional rites, in the de- sired rites [comprising] appeasement and prosperity. The square [ritual diagram] is to be praised to all the directions in the desire for glory.<\/div>","<div>3.45. First [the re pit] is praised with that [praise], having perceived which, the distinct rites of black magic [and] the rites of formation of the re pit may be performed through the weapon mantra.10<\/div>","<div>3.46.-47. [The rites in which the re pit is the object are], the lower, the instrument, the up- per, the throwing one, the lling one, the sprinkling one, the cutting one, the wiping away one, and the anointing one. The making of the re pit is to be done with the letter OM; [then follows nally] the crossroad [rite] and the [ritual] arena is the imagined house for the God- dess of Speech.11<\/div>","<div>3.48. Again, the invocation of the Goddess of Speech with OM along with homage and con- secration are to be performed with three categories.<\/div>","<div>3.49. Having perfected the 'knocking' ritual act [in the re pit]12 with the weapon mantra as the previous injunction, [he should perform] the rite of the re pit with those things per- taining to the re pit, whose essence is the power of action.<\/div>","<div>3.50. One should prepare there the re whose essence is the power of knowledge. After be- stowing the re, the rites of passage are performed each with ve [oblations],13 established in the re pit.<\/div>","<div>3. 51. With the weapon mantra [he performs] the rites beginning with 'the look' and [then] it is covered by the breastplate mantra.14 Having sacri ced ve oﬀerings with the syllable OM, the ritual substances and so on are puri ed.<\/div>","<div>3.52. After that, he should walk around [the re pit] three times [repeating OM] produc- ing the 'all- re,' then the nature of the seed [syllable produces] the re whose nature is the Supreme Lord.<\/div>","<div>3.53. And having, as it were, shaken Māyā [to extract the soul from its grasp] he should cast it in the womb of Yogeśī, [achieved by] oﬀering in the All-Fire which has been made round, with the syllable OM. 15<\/div>","<div>3.54.-55. After that, the rites of passage are to be performed in the mouth of that [ re, namely] (1) planting the seed in the womb, (2) producing a male, then (3) parting the hair of the expectant woman [Yogīśī], including the rites of the neck and the rite of the mouth,16 [performed] in the All-Fire. Then (4) the birth rite, (5) the carrying out of the child [for the vision of the sun, and] (6) the naming ceremony.<\/div>","<div>3.56. The rites of passage are to be performed in regular order with the six parts beginning with the heart, [after which] again [the further rites are to be performed] beginning with tonsure [and ending] with the oblation for the rst feeding.<\/div>","<div>3.57. He should perform all the rites of passage with the root mantra in the re. The special- ist should perform that which comprises Śiva and Śakti there.<\/div>","<div>3.58.-59. The large and small ladles are to be made rm from a milkweed shrub. Those [la- dles] produced from a consecrated tree are cut for the purpose of appeasing and prosperity, otherwise, conforming to [correct] ritual procedure,17 they are to be made from various ma- terials. The ladle size is measured an arm [in length] or thirty six ngers.<\/div>","<div>3.60. The handle extends from the bowl [of the ladle] whose width is six parts. The nub of the lotus is the throne, to the top of the throne is four ngers [in length].<\/div>","<div>3.61. In the middle of the stick, an extended bulb is to be made two ngers [in length], the thickness of half a nger, distinguished by various styles.<\/div>","<div>3.62.-64. The altar to receive the ladle18 is to be made eight ngers [in length], splendid, with four [corners], below beginning in the lotus [part] to above is ve ngers' length. The hollow part will be made three ngers [deep], above that [it will be made] circular. It is dec- orated with auspicious marks measuring half a nger, consisting of four sides, and with four corners.<\/div>","<div>3.65. Enacting awareness of the art he performs the various rites. The neck [of the spoon] is to be made one nger length, divided into three parts.<\/div>","<div>3.66. Then he should make the auspicious mouth, seven ngers [wide] between two sides. He should shorten the two parts in due order, long with eight sides.<\/div>","<div>3.67. Then he should conceal [?] the two parts on both sides, in three parts at the top of the mouth. Those two [parts] are a little nger [long].<\/div>","<div>3.68. He should make the cavity deeper within the mouth at the top [?]. Then [he should make] auspicious variegated worship on both sides.<\/div>","<div>3.69. The ladle should be a hand's measurement [in length]; It should be its own three parts on both sides, made from three small branches at its root. (?)<\/div>","<div>3.70-71ab. One should make the hole a cow's hoof print deep containing joints a nger wide [and] the top of the two hollows well turned, four ngers' long; from the throat to the place at the middle and top, is a nger in circumference.<\/div>","<div>3.72-73ab. One should prepare the mouth [of the re pit] which has been dug, lled with a garland. The ladle which is Śiva and the ladle which is Power should be four measures full. [The Practitioner] should perform re ritual to be accomplished according to the rule. The Power of Action is the re pit and the Power of Knowledge is the re.<\/div>","<div>3.73cd-74. Having duly accomplished this according to the rule, after that he should per- form the re ritual with sesame, milk, and grain mixed with ghee [for oﬀerings to] the re. He will win great peace [or the calming of enemies] here in a moment, without doubt.<\/div>","<div>3.75-76ab. Then having gained victory with the preliminary formation rites, he should per- form the supreme re ritual rite. [He should perform] taking refuge, extraction [of mantras], waving, installation, then looking with the weapon mantra, next waving lights.<\/div>","<div>3.76cd-79ab. Then he should perform imaginative worship circumambulating the re, sprin- kling up and down, then performing the rite of nectar with the root mantra and the weapon mantra. [Then he should perform worship] strewing [the area] with sacred grass imbued with the weapon mantra, protecting the boundary of the re pit with the weapon mantra, [and worshipping] the sun and moon externally with the mantra OM. He should meditate on nine tongues [of re]; he causes this to occur with the root mantra. Then after that he should worship the complete mantra in the centre.<\/div>","<div>3.79cd-80ab. Thus the Mantrin, having made sacri ces according to customary ritual with milk [and] ghee, becomes completely satis ed.<\/div>","<div>3.80cd-81ab. With re ritual of bdelium resin and ghee a full life is certain. After that one should oﬀer honourable desire, endowed with milk and ghee.<\/div>","<div>3.81cd-82ab. Thus [a King] desiring a kingdom [should oﬀer] wood apple tree [fruits and leaves] divided into three which give powers. He will obtain health due to the re ritual with fuel from the g tree.<\/div>","<div>3.82cd-83. Truly he obtains all desires due to the re ritual and not otherwise, through the oﬀered kindling [and] through the oﬀered fruit or owers into the re. With twenty one re rituals the person whose purpose is wealth attains wealth.<\/div>","<div>3.84. Having drawn out [from the re] the desired wish, he should perform the desired re ritual. He should certainly conquer death because of the re ritual with only milk [oﬀer- ings].<\/div>","<div>3.85-86. He will obtain health due to the re ritual with fuel from the g tree. From the re ritual with its oﬀered kindling, with oﬀerings, water and re, truly he obtains all desires, not otherwise.<\/div>","<div>The Lord spoke: 4.1-2. Now I will speak about initiation that bestows the fruit of liberation and pleasure [us- ing] the tenfold gross and subtle elements, mind and intellect, the ego, nature and the self, [along with] Īśvara, Sadāśiva and Śiva. [These are] called the eighteen [categories]. One should enact the purifcation exactly according to the prescribed rite.<\/div>","<div>4.3-6. The best of teachers should correctly purify the nine categories [comprising] na- ture and self, causal restriction and time, illusion, limited knowledge, then Īśvara, Sadāśiva and Śiva. [He should initiate] with eighteen categories, or nine, or ve, with three or with one.1 These are to be performed for supreme, lower, and magical [accomplishments]. Or again, initiation [can be performed] with [the path of] ve powers (kalā) or with [the path of] words, with ve hundred phonemes, with mantras or with worlds. The [initiation] may be performed with all of these or with only one.<\/div>","<div>4.7. It is to be performed by the best teachers with all [the cosmic paths or] with a combina- tion, so long as their essence is power, due to their nature being the [all]-pervading energy.<\/div>","<div>4.8-9. In the worship to be performed [the master] should unite the soul [of the initiand] in the womb of the Goddess of Speech; [the life-cycle rites to be performed are] impreg- nation, birth, eligibility and dissolution2 [and] following that [rites for] pleasure, procuring [good] action, and atonement. Then the cutting of the rope is to be performed with the root mantra.3<\/div>","<div>4.10. [Then] with the weapon mantra4 [he should perform] the burning [of the rope], turn- ing it to ash, then he should perform the cutting of the tuft with the root [mantra].<\/div>","<div>4.11. Having been united to the supreme category, [the master] should establish [the ini- tiand] there. To qualify as a teacher, [he needs to abide] in the supreme-non-supreme state.<\/div>","<div>4.12. The initiation of practitioners seeking power, due to [the power of] the knowledge- mantras5 within the realm of Śiva is at the Sadāśiva level. The son [of Śiva abides] in the highest level and the lower practitioner in the level of the Lord (īśvaratattva).6<\/div>","<div>4.13. In this way initiation has been revealed, told in its completeness. Here ends the fourth chapter concerning the quali cation of initiation according to the rule of the immortal Conqueror of Death, which is the essence of the collection of all the streams of revelation.<\/div>","<div>The Lord spoke: 5.1-3. I will speak about the consecration as it shows itself, to be given with eight pots ac- cording to the rule of the teacher; these are known to be impregnated and sealed as the Lords of Wisdom, or with ve [pots] enumerated as earth [and the other elements], or with three whose nature is the categories called self, knowledge, and Śiva, [or] also with one whose nature is Śiva. For the teacher, his purpose is authority, for the Sādhaka, his desire is power. [Such a] consecrated one is authorised and may perform the practice of mantra. That is his observance, that is his practice to which he is devoted and addicted.<\/div>","<div>5.5-8. The practitioner whose mind is free from all attachment, whose senses are controlled, whose desire is slight, who delights in wearing the sacred thread, should begin repetition in a solitary place, in a holy place, in a place of pilgrimage. The focussed practitioner of mantra should repeat [it] a hundred thousand times, by that he accomplishes the collective rites and the Sādhaka achieves worldly powers. But with a million repetitions he achieves atmospheric powers [and] certainly with ve million the Sādhaka attains divine powers, in this there is no doubt.<\/div>","<div>5.9-10. Then with ten million repetitions he may attain lordly powers . Having become Śiva, all pervading, after repeating the [mantra] ten million times, he may achieve lordly perfec- tion. Having become all pervading Śiva, [he will] be t for the grace that holds fast. He creates whatever his desire, he supports all, he draws in strength, and is all pervading, om- nipotent, and all knowing.<\/div>","<div>The Goddess spoke, 6.1-3. O Great God, I have heard about the Conqueror of Death [mantra] that bestows lib- eration and powers. Now I want to hear about the Amṛtīśa, the great souled one, the life in all living beings, associated with three powers,1 who gives success in the world, who creates welfare for men, who appeases wicked powers [as you have] previously said, the destroyer of premature death, satisfying, auspicious, who gives nourishment and tranquility to the body. The Lord spoke,<\/div>","<div>6.4. Listen. I will explain the secret, great wonder whereby men drowning in the ocean of suﬀering cross over.<\/div>","<div>6.5-6. Poor people attacked by hundreds of premature deaths, terri ed by anxiety, disease and danger, are oppressed by oods of sin, but all are freed from those killers previously spoken of, O beloved, [through] three kinds of method: gross, subtle and supreme.<\/div>","<div>6.7. The king of mantras powerfully creates the gross [method that comprises] ritual, re oﬀering, mantra repetition and meditation accompanied by gestures, the framing mantras and so on.<\/div>","<div>6.8. The subtle [method] is by the practice of the centres of the body and so on, and by the arising of the channels and powers. The supreme [method] is God who bestows liberation, the essence of all, [whereby] one becomes the conqueror of death.<\/div>","<div>6.9-10ab. O beloved, when one perceives a feeling of the fear of [premature] death [or one is] impelled by time, then [the practitioner] should worship the Deathless Lord [mantra] whose purpose is the prevention of that, by the method previously spoken about, a prac- tice using all white [materials] .<\/div>","<div>6.10cd-11ab. Having written the name [of the person to be protected, the practitioner] should worship the Lord Conqueror of Death [which] swiftly snatches [the person] from death. Truly, I do not lie.<\/div>","<div>6.11cd-12. [One should oﬀer oblation] with white sugar accompanied by sesamum soaked in clari ed butter and milk, into a re with kindling of pure wood, in a round re-pit [sur- rounded] with three girdles. With this method of great protection one should make the oﬀering for [the person] designated by his name.<\/div>","<div>6.13. [Another method is] having gone to the [mantra] for support, the [person to be cured] will quickly become the Great Power simply by [oﬀering] milk with sugar.<\/div>","<div>6.14. [A further method is] The Conqueror of Death [mantra] quickly conquerors death due to the oblation, in this there is no doubt, with an oblation of sweet smelling ghee in a re made of milk tree wood.<\/div>","<div>6.15. The Conqueror of Death [mantra] will destroy death without doubt; one should wor- ship [with it and accompanied by] the oﬀering of wood from the milk tree; fever is destroyed in an instant.<\/div>","<div>6.16. To destroy all impurity [one must make] a sacri ce of ve ingredients [nectars], sesa- mum, rice, honey, clari ed butter, and milk.<\/div>","<div>6.17. The emaciated body will be nourished, O one observing the vow, from the re obla- tion, by being smeared with three kinds of balls of fragrant resin, merely [the size of] a chick pea.<\/div>","<div>6.18. If a weak man lled with a hundred diseases is looked after, then after repeating his name framed [by the netra mantra], he will be freed.<\/div>","<div>6.19. Even though by itself ineﬀective, whatever mantra the wise man repeats framed by the Lord of Immortality [mantra], with that he will quickly achieve success.<\/div>","<div>6.20. The framing mantra which is a remedy is given for the emaciated body, O Goddess. The strong one obtains nourishment O Goddess, in an instant.<\/div>","<div>6.21. Enclosing the soul [of the sick person] with the letters beginning with SA, [the practi- tioner should x it] in the lotus of the heart, framed by the moon [the anusvāra], [then the soul] is securely delivered from death.<\/div>","<div>6.22. One with knowledge of yoga should always meditate on the body enclosed by the let- ters beginning with SA. He will be freed from all disease, without doubt.<\/div>","<div>6.23-25ab. [The practitioner imagines the person to be cured] in the middle of a lotus in the milky ocean, splashed by waves of nectar, held by power above and below, [his name] framed [as before by the mantra] beginning with the letter SA. That manifested soul medi- tates the radiant body of himself or the other, lled with its own power inside and outside, and considering [himself] free from apprehension, he is freed from all diseases.<\/div>","<div>6.25cd-26. With [ink made from] orpiment, saﬀron, and milk [the name of the person] as- sailed by all diseases is [written] in the middle of a white, eight petalled lotus, enclosed by the letters beginning with SA [and] concluded with the circle of the moon [the anusvāra].<\/div>","<div>6.27. [The practitioner] attends [to drawing] a square containing the sign of a vajra, marked by a vajra; the one aﬄicted by all diseases is freed without doubt.<\/div>","<div>6.28-29. [Another method is that] he should write the name [of the patron framed] by the letters SA and so on, with the mantra beginning with A, on a large lotus with sixteen [petals] containing sixteen vowels. The last letter [KṢA] is placed in the middle after SA at the end of the [name of] the soul [to be protected] having framed the letter [of the patron's name] on all sides with the Lord of Immortality [mantra]. In this way he is protected.<\/div>","<div>6.30-31. [He should write] in the middle of the circle of the moon, in the middle of all petals, and on the outside a double lotus with [the letters] in due order from KA to SA.2 But as be- fore, the Mantrin should write the name of the one to be protected enclosed by the letters beginning with SA. On the outside [of that circle] is the circle of the sun.<\/div>","<div>6.32. After that he should construct a square diagram [marked by the sign of thunder] en- tirely with white camphor, orpiment and milk.<\/div>","<div>6.33. Having written the king of mantras [with] grey powdered camphor, it bestows good fortune and happiness and gives great protection.<\/div>","<div>6.34. One should worship this ritual circle, O Great Goddess, with white owers. One should oﬀer mead [along] with ingredients that are entirely white.<\/div>","<div>6.35. By this method one becomes the conqueror of death in seven days. [Thus the practi- toner] should illuminate the method for the protection of the mighty king.<\/div>","<div>6.36. At the time of war [Śiva] will give a boon which destroys the pride of the enemy. [The practitoner] should [visualise] the nine categories one by one, beginning with Śiva,3 in the circle of the moon.<\/div>","<div>6.37-38. With the Lord of Immortality [mantra] the knower of mantra [should write] begin- ning with the rst [category, Śiva] in the middle [of the lotus] and ending with Īśvara. When overwhelmed by a hundred diseases and premature deaths, then [the practitioner] should worship with white ingredients, with milk and ghee, with sesamum or with milk wood [in this way] he will attain peace due to the re ritual.<\/div>","<div>6.39-40. [With another method] after oﬀering all medicines in a pot lled with precious jewels, radiant and bright, [the practitioner] should perform the ritual ablution on the head [of the person to be cured] with a very auspicious sound. The one oppressed by many dis- eases will be freed without doubt.<\/div>","<div>6. 41-42. Meditating upon [the pot of water as] the highest nectar, eternal, eternally arisen, free from disease, the nectar having descended from supreme Śiva to the end of the [cos- mological] system, [the practitioner should visualise it] as holding nectar [containing all the elements of the universe, namely] the thirty six [categories], the nine ways, being lled with nine [phonemes of the padādhvan], with fty [letters], with the six [aṅga mantras], ve [brahma mantras], and one [mūla mantra]. 4<\/div>","<div>6.43. [The vessel for consecration] is deep and boundless, decorated with thirty eight [cate- gories], or lled with ve [categories] for the unsurpassable purpose of [attaining] powers.<\/div>","<div>6.44-45. So the teacher, with mantra as his supreme purpose, engaged in meditation, in a state of grace, having shaken the pot which is [full of] internal and external nectar, should carefully sprinkle it on the head [of the person to be cured]. Without doubt he will be re- leased from the cycle of reincarnation which is diﬃcult to step over.<\/div>","<div>6.46. He [gains] long life, strength, fame, brightness, rmness, power, fame, [and] beauty, [and] for him everything can be realised, he attains the earth, [he acquires] the best king- dom.<\/div>","<div>6.47. One aﬄicted becomes healthy, possessed of suﬀering he becomes free from suﬀering, a barren woman attains a son or a daughter may get a husband.<\/div>","<div>6.48. Whatever desire he wishes to attain that will certainly come about for the great soul who is consecrated, according to the method [laid out here].<\/div>","<div>6.49. I have told you about this worship, O Goddess, with desire for the welfare [of all be- ings]. With the practice of a diﬀerent teaching, there will be the paci cation of all [obsta- cles].<\/div>","<div>6.50. Thus the gross method [has been told], now hear about the subtle [method].<\/div>","<div>The Lord spoke: 7.1-2. Now I will tell you about the excellent, supreme, subtle visualising meditation, which comprises the sequence of six [cakra-s].1 , the supporting vowels,2 the three objects,3 and the ve voids,4 the twelve knots, the three powers [śakti-s],5 the path of the three abodes, and the three channels.6<\/div>","<div>7.3-5. Having realized the body, O One with Beautiful Hips, as a body that follows the path of ten channels and thirty ve million channels via the seventy two thousand channels, and as a body overrun by a host of channels riddled with diseases in the re, the Yogi then lls the highest Self7 with the nectar of the subtle meditation proclaimed as the highest. He be- comes a divine body bereft of all disease.<\/div>","<div>7.6-7ab. That which is his own form, his self-perception, his stable all-pervasive being, his self-arisen supreme and stable power (śakti), the Auspicious One, abiding in his womb,8 she should be made to ow in a stable manner in the middle breath between exhalation and inhalation.<\/div>","<div>7.cd-8. Then, having become the mantra AHAM, established there, moving in a stable man- ner in his [own] circle (cakra); the yogi should establish his self-perception9 in the place of birth in the place of birth, by producing vibrations by his self-arising vibration, Oh Elegant One.<\/div>","<div>7.9. By distinguishing levels of being, the yogi should unite that [his self-perception] from that place with the root base. By applying the needle of sound, he should pierce those levels through the application of the subtle yoga.<\/div>","<div>7.10. Having pierced the sixteen centres10 and the twelve knots, the one who has mounted the path of the central channel should penetrate steadily towards the highest.<\/div>","<div>7.11-13. [The yogi] who has entered that [the highest condition] becomes equal to Śiva, the all-pervading, due to the agitated Śakti, who drives away all diseases completely, and hav- ing lled the interior of the heart again by that path, he reaches the penetrated, elementary matter of the channel of elixir obtained by meditation;11 having obtained this experience, he should cause all that elixir to ow quickly from that place and leave it remaining every- where.<\/div>","<div>7.14-15. Ones own body, entirely lled with the supreme in nite nectar and with the joy of non-death and non-old age, becomes completely lled with the subtle sound both in- ternally and externally, O Beloved, due to the Conqueror of Death, by distinguishing the in nite channel and by the Yoga of Visualizing Meditation. [This ends the rst technique.]<\/div>","<div>7.16-17. Then that [divine body] is attained quickly and, truly, in no other way, O Goddess! Having established himself in the place of birth, namely the place of vibration, the middle constituent,12 residing there, he should resort to the Self, the Fire of Time, and having gone there, he should throw his virile power, the attained insight, just there.<\/div>","<div>7.18. Then, from that virile power, the Supreme Power,13 known as action, arises in the mid- dle. She is separated upwards by insight, the distinguishing of the knots, and by will.<\/div>","<div>7.19. The yogi should resort to the vibration of the root centre and, having abandoned it, the yogi should resort to the twofold ow (of the inbreath and outbreath) by the name of Suṣumnā through the ow of the outspread path.<\/div>","<div>7.20. Then, resorting to that, the yogi should pause in all his spheres of the senses and then gradually rise upwards by means of the eightfold insight.14<\/div>","<div>7.21. Having gradually given up the causes beginning with Brahmā and having attained the sixth centre possessing power, she called the Crooked One is restrained.15 . [Now begins a new topic]<\/div>","<div>7.22-25. By distinguishing the knots beginning with illusion, [the yogi] should enter the ve voids beginning with the heart; the knot in the root centre of birth is known as 'gathering' due to it’s binding in the place of birth; the locations of the causes are declared to be ve, beginning with the knots, namely Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Rudra, Īśvara, and Sadāśiva; the knot known as 'kindling' [is Śiva], calming the two paths; above that is 'light'; and above that is the drop'; the great knot is known as 'sound'; and further, the Power knot is 'the Supreme'. Having pierced these twelve knots, the yogi should enter Supreme Śiva.<\/div>","<div>7.26. The yogi should pierce the abodes of Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Rudra, Īśvara, Sadāśiva, Śakti, and Śiva.<\/div>","<div>7.27-28a. The endless void is known as 'birth'; the second void is in the navel; the third is in the place of the heart; the fourth is in the middle of the drop; then the one known as 'sound' is pierced.<\/div>","<div>7.28b-7.29. Now, the six circle system is told: the channel circle is known as 'birth'; in the navel is the supreme circle known as 'illusion'; the 'yogi' circle is in the heart; the place of the uvular is remembered as 'splitting'; and the place of the drop is known as 'rupture'; while the place of sound is said to be 'tranquility.'<\/div>","<div>7.30. The yogi should pierce all the circles previously spoken about with the trident of knowledge. Having ascended, the yogi should gently press the root known as the 'birth support'.16<\/div>","<div>7.31-32b. Hear the synonyms of that support, O One with Beautiful Hips, namely 'the supreme', the location of birth', 'the bulb', and 'the tortoise'. The places are ve. Thus, the root circle is also said to be 'the sh belly'.<\/div>","<div>7.32cd. Afterwards, the knower of yoga should nd the seal called 'sky-goer'.<\/div>","<div>7.33. When by the seal, O Goddess, the self is sealed, then he should gradually ascend up- wards by means of insight to the highest place.<\/div>","<div>7.34. While the chief of the gods praises that highest place, O Goddess, one having entered it with deep wisdom, should become of same essence as Yoginīs.17<\/div>","<div>7.35. [The Yogi] having obtained the partless condition [which is] the all-pervading, supreme Śiva, and having become so, all is equal, motionless, wholeness and always arisen.<\/div>","<div>7.36. Thus, without de nition, free from suﬀering, the energy manifests [itself] shown only by will, cognition [and ] action.<\/div>","<div>7.37. She [the Power] is one, established there and everywhere through diﬀerent stages of being [and] by his dividing, having been lled up to the level of Power by the use of the seal of the sky-goer.<\/div>","<div>7.38. And as long as the moon has not risen, so long the condition of spotless emptiness [is obtained], the supreme in which all [lower] conditions are abandoned, is attained by grasp- ing being.18<\/div>","<div>7.39. Having ascended to that, the Yogis become the the all-pervading state, majestic, un- paralleled, and free from disease, O best of living beings.<\/div>","<div>7.40. She [the Power] is the womb of all the gods and also of all all the powers in various ways. Her womb is of the nature of re and moon [from which] everything is manifested.<\/div>","<div>7.41. For the mantras which are strung together in her, become transformative and the supreme state itself is the (re)absorption of all.<\/div>","<div>7.42. Therefore having agitated the supreme Śiva, creation is manifested [from her and] hav- ing playfully agitated the drop, [the Yogi] obtains the incomparable nectar.<\/div>","<div>7.43. Then with the arising of the moon, the supreme, highest nectar is made known. There [the yogī] should meditate on the deep, wave of in nite nectar.<\/div>","<div>7.44. Then having obtained the pure nectar, [the Yogi] should draw it by his own power through the middle path, O slender waisted one, [and] he should pierce [the levels] begin- ning with the causes [as previously described].<\/div>","<div>7.45. [The Yogi in imagination] should ll the places [i.e. the centres of the body with nec- tar] in due order, so that the absolute place is attained [at the crown of the head]. Then he should ll [the centres] below it.<\/div>","<div>7.46. [The yogi] should [then] proceed in stages along the path from the place of generation to the re of time [in the big toe], then having lled [himself with nectar, he] should medi- tate the body as completely full.<\/div>","<div>7.47. [The Yogi] should visualise the entire [body] lled with the nectar of the central chan- nel [ owing] through the endless channels completely through to the pores [of the skin].<\/div>","<div>7.48. [The Yogi] having caused [the nectar] to ow [through the body], having become com- pletely pervaded by the waves of nectar [and] the ocean of nectar having sprung up, [he be- comes] immersed in the ocean of nectar.<\/div>","<div>7.49. Higher than that [there is another] ocean of nectar which is the all-pervading Śiva owing forth, so [the Yogi achieves] the sameness of avour [with that], which is the nectar that is all pervading.<\/div>","<div>7.50. Having attained the condition without suﬀering, he should discover through his own experience that his own true nature is Śiva, whose nature is will, cognition, and action.<\/div>","<div>7.51. Having attained the subtle state of the Lord of Immortality, [the Yogi] becomes im- mortal. Then having become immortal [he will become] the conqueror of death, without doubt.<\/div>","<div>7.52. The fortunate, wise [Yogi] who is a conqueror of time is not troubled by death. The subtle [visualisation] for the cheating of time has been revealed to you by me.<\/div>","<div>7.53. Except for you, O devoted one, [this practice] has not been revealed by me to anyone. Thus [ends] the seventh chapter concerning the subtle meditation in the practice of the im- mortal Lord.<\/div>","<div>The Lord spoke: 8.1. So now I will proclaim the eternal, supreme conqueror of death, attaining which one does not return to the threefold [world] of rebirth, O beloved.1 .<\/div>","<div>8.2. The Yogi shines forth as Śiva who is the omnipresent, all seeing, [and] all doing. I will speak about that [condition], beyond which there is nothing else.<\/div>","<div>8.3-6. Having attained that [state, the Yogi] becomes ageless and deathless through identi- cation with it. It is that eternal which speech cannot express, that cannot be seen by the eye, that cannot be heard with the ears, that the nose cannot smell, that the tongue cannot taste, that the sense of touch cannot feel, that cannot be thought by the mind, freed from all colour and taste [yet it is] endowed with all colour and taste, immeasurable, [and] beyond the senses. When that is attained, O Goddess, the Yogis become free from old age and death through their exalted practice and supreme detachment.<\/div>","<div>8.7-9. Due to the abandoning of passion and hate, due to the destruction of greed and delu- sion, O Beloved, due to the abandoning of intoxication and jealousy, [and] due to the de- struction of self-conceit and arrogance, [the Yogi] certainly attains the eternal, imperishable, supreme Śiva. If he attains [that] merely in the blink of an eye, then henceforth he is liber- ated and is not born again. He may attain [this realisation] by means of the eight limbed yoga and not otherwise.<\/div>","<div>8.10. Self-control (Yama) is said to be the end of the world of becoming, eternal [and] supreme. Restraint (Niyama) is constant meditation on the supreme reality.<\/div>","<div>8.11. Having settled into the middle breath, between the paths of exhalation and inhalation, supported by the power of knowledge, posture (Āsana) is abiding in that.<\/div>","<div>8.12-13ab. Having abandoned the gross condition of the breath and so on, [he should] simi- larly [abandon] the subtle, inner path; after that he will attain the supreme vibration beyond the subtle. This is called breath control (Prāṇayāma) from which the mind does not move.<\/div>","<div>8.13cd-14. The uctuations of the qualities beginning with sound are experienced by the mind, abandoning which, [the Yogi] may enter the supreme place by his own mind. This is called 'withdrawal' (Pratyahāra) cutting the noose of becoming.<\/div>","<div>8.15. Having gone beyond the intellect, the qualities, [and] the mind, meditating on the un- changing Lord without qualities, who is the object of meditation and re exive awareness, the wise know this to be 'meditation' (Dhyāna).<\/div>","<div>8.16. The supreme self is held by the 'supporting concentration' (Dhāraṇa) at all times. That supporting concentration' (Dhāraṇa) is de ned [here as] the destruction of the bond of be- coming.<\/div>","<div>8.17. The placing of consciousness equally in all beings is called 'absorption' (Samādhi).2 [This is the real meaning] otherwise people are befuddled.<\/div>","<div>8.18. Equal awareness among beings in this world is located in oneself and others. That which is recalled as the supreme absorption [is expressed in the statements] 'I am Śiva, I am without second.'<\/div>","<div>8.19. This is known as the supreme absorption, which is one's perfect essential nature, awareness, whose nature is consciousness, born from its own being, re exive awareness, one's own true nature.<\/div>","<div>8.20. Having discerned the absolute state in the mass of consciousness and unconscious [matter], [the wise] know that absorption to be the eternal nature.<\/div>","<div>8.21-22ab. Having rmly perceived the supreme [state], time is cheated and [he becomes] the Supreme Lord, the Deathless Lord. O Goddess, he becomes the the Conqueror of Death and time does not bind him.<\/div>","<div>8.22cd-23. Due to renouncing the thirty six categories and jettisoning the in nite worlds, [the Yogi] is beyond the eighty rst word and higher than the fty phonemes. He pervades all Tantras3 .<\/div>","<div>8.24-25ab. [The Yogi] is beyond the thirty eight powers [Kalādhvan], at the end of every- thing, in the middle of everything. Nobody will reach the beginning, middle and end who, having attained immeasurable equality, does not exist in everything.<\/div>","<div>8.25cd-26. This entire universe is lled by that one who is immeasurable. Having known him [the person] is released in an instant from the terrible bondage of the cycle of reincar- nation, freed from the three categories,4 eternal, unmoving and stable.<\/div>","<div>8.27. Having perceived [the truth] by the divine path of yoga, one is not born again, liberated from all the senses, free from disease and having many forms.<\/div>","<div>8.28. The essence of the supreme self, freed from all attributes, consciousness whose nature is the self, is told in all the scriptures.<\/div>","<div>8.29. As long as one is not puri ed by power, O Goddess, one does not become stainless. Be- ing puri ed by the re of knowledge [brought about by] initiation,5 the self becomes stain- less.<\/div>","<div>8.30. Those who nd another, they do not nd the supreme condition. Those worshippers of the self go to the highest condition.6<\/div>","<div>8.31-32ab. As long as the highest power, possessing all qualities of omniscience and so on, expanding [through the body] from the foot, is not pure, so long the impure self is bound; this is told in Śaiva [scriptures].<\/div>","<div>8.32cd-33ab. Where the person, established [in the highest] with his group of senses re- strained, knows everything, past [and] future [he knows] the reality as being characterised by power.<\/div>","<div>8.33cd-34ab. Wherever will or knowledge arise, whose own nature is action to be done, that reality is characterised by power.<\/div>","<div>8.34cd-35. O Goddess, [within the Yogi] whose self has the nature of all pervading con- sciousness, wondrous joy ows from Śiva. That Power is known as the supreme. Expanding himself in this way [the Yogi] becomes the possessor of qualities such as omniscience and so on.<\/div>","<div>8.36. O Goddess, [such a Yogi] is called Śiva, the shining one, the supreme cause, all know- ing and completely satis ed, and who is awakened without beginning.<\/div>","<div>8.37. He is free and not lost, whose Power is endless. Being the possessor of Power, he nds his qualities by being the possessor of quality through diﬀerentiating the qualities.7<\/div>","<div>8.38. [The Yogi] re ects here on multiplicity by diﬀerentiating diﬀerent parts, which is called the manifestation of all. But I will [now] tell about the one free from manifestation.<\/div>","<div>8.39. Beyond manifestation [means] that 'I am not and there is no other.' This state of the supreme self of Śiva is called the highest.<\/div>","<div>8.40. With 'I am not and there is no other' there is no object of meditation here; [the Yogi's] cognition has gone to the sameness of avour [with Śiva], dissolved in the condition of joy.<\/div>","<div>8.41. He should not direct meditation upwards, not downwards and not in the middle, not in front nor behind, nor even on either side.<\/div>","<div>8.42. [The Yogi] should not meditate on anything placed within the body nor outside. He should not bind [the attention] to an object in space, nor x the sight downward.<\/div>","<div>8.43. He should not meditate with closed eyes nor xing the gaze, resting on a support or on no support.<\/div>","<div>8.44. [The Yogi should not meditate on] the senses, nor the elements, nor on [the objects of the senses] sound, touch, and taste. Abandoning everything, established in concentration, [the Yogi] becomes only made of that [reality].<\/div>","<div>8.45. This is called the supreme state of the highest self of Śiva. Having attained that, the condition beyond manifestation, [the Yogi] turns away [from the cycle of reincarnation].<\/div>","<div>8.46. In this way [the Yogi] should meditate on the self through the powerful meditation on the self. He [then] becomes the supreme tranquillity that is Śiva, the transcendent purity.<\/div>","<div>8.47. That is the one reality everywhere, Śiva who is the Conqueror of Death, the highest Lord of Immortality, the third,8 the highest state.<\/div>","<div>8.48. I have made [this] known to you, O Goddess, what else can I tell you? In this way, hav- ing known the all pervading one, [the Yogi] is freed due to the Conqueror of Death [mantra].<\/div>","<div>8.49. O beloved, [I have] told [you about] the cheating of time at all times [by] the threefold method, O Goddess, thus it has been told to you by me.<\/div>","<div>8.50. The yoga called the cheating of time is diﬃcult to achieve. By that yoga practice a per- son becomes the Conqueror of Death.<\/div>","<div>8.51. And by that yoga, the Yogi becomes the Conqueror of Death with desire for grace to- wards the world, for all living beings at all times.<\/div>","<div>8.52. He is called Conqueror of Death, eternal, supreme, rm. Other than that there is noth- ing higher. This is truly declared.<\/div>","<div>8.53. There are three injunctions declared by me [for attaining] the supreme nectar;9 a per- son may become that with practice for the sake of himself or another.<\/div>","<div>8.54-55ab. He becomes equal to the Lord of Immortality, the Conquerer of Death, O God- dess, without doubt. By whatever method he may recall, by that method the Yogi becomes the Conqueror of Time.<\/div>","<div>8.56. Whatever is one's condition, by whatever observance, by whatever yoga with diﬀerent states of being, [the Yogi] attains success. That one, meditated in diﬀerent ways, O Goddess, bestows perfection.<\/div>","<div>8.57. By means of non-duality, duality, or mixed [tradition]10 or in the [way of] the solitary hero, or in the ritual of sexual union, by every method [the mantra] bestows perfection at all times.<\/div>","<div>8.58. As a wishing jewel in the world gives the fruit of one's desire, so the king of mantra gives the result of one's desire.<\/div>","<div>8.59-60. This [netra mantra] is the supreme, powerful abode of seven by ten million mantras. [It will achieve success even if practiced by those who are] without [correct] disposition, who are bereft of the power of mantra, uncouth,11 bereft of measured phonemes, who have abandoned teachers and scriptures, who are without traditions, [and] who are also ob- structed due to scripture having been abandoned.<\/div>","<div>8.61-62. As they do not succeed who are unperfected and false, bereft of all reservation, O Goddess, [even though] having striven [and] repeated [their own mantra] a thousand [times], nevertheless [if] those impaired ones enclose [their mantra] at the end and begin- ning with the syllables beginning with SA, [obstacles] are removed [and] they are illumi- nated by this mantra which is the Lord of Immortality, O Goddess.12<\/div>","<div>8.63. They succeed through repeating the consecrated [mantra] without eﬀort, there is no doubt. [Those mantras] meditated upon bestow everything, O Goddess; this statement is not untrue.<\/div>","<div>8.64. Thus, O dear one, the entire supreme secret has been revealed to you.<\/div>"],["<div>DOC__000<\/div>","<div>DOC__000<\/div>","<div>DOC__000<\/div>","<div>DOC__000<\/div>","<div>DOC__001<\/div>","<div>DOC__001<\/div>","<div>DOC__001<\/div>","<div>DOC__001<\/div>","<div>DOC__002<\/div>","<div>DOC__002<\/div>","<div>DOC__002<\/div>","<div>DOC__002<\/div>","<div>DOC__003<\/div>","<div>DOC__003<\/div>","<div>DOC__003<\/div>","<div>DOC__003<\/div>","<div>DOC__004<\/div>","<div>DOC__004<\/div>","<div>DOC__004<\/div>","<div>DOC__004<\/div>","<div>DOC__005<\/div>","<div>DOC__005<\/div>","<div>DOC__005<\/div>","<div>DOC__006<\/div>","<div>DOC__006<\/div>","<div>DOC__006<\/div>","<div>DOC__007<\/div>","<div>DOC__007<\/div>","<div>DOC__007<\/div>","<div>DOC__008<\/div>","<div>DOC__008<\/div>","<div>DOC__008<\/div>","<div>DOC__009<\/div>","<div>DOC__009<\/div>","<div>DOC__009<\/div>","<div>DOC__010<\/div>","<div>DOC__010<\/div>","<div>DOC__010<\/div>","<div>DOC__011<\/div>","<div>DOC__011<\/div>","<div>DOC__011<\/div>","<div>DOC__012<\/div>","<div>DOC__012<\/div>","<div>DOC__012<\/div>","<div>DOC__013<\/div>","<div>DOC__013<\/div>","<div>DOC__013<\/div>","<div>DOC__014<\/div>","<div>DOC__014<\/div>","<div>DOC__014<\/div>","<div>DOC__015<\/div>","<div>DOC__015<\/div>","<div>DOC__015<\/div>","<div>DOC__016<\/div>","<div>DOC__016<\/div>","<div>DOC__016<\/div>","<div>DOC__017<\/div>","<div>DOC__017<\/div>","<div>DOC__017<\/div>","<div>DOC__018<\/div>","<div>DOC__018<\/div>","<div>DOC__018<\/div>","<div>DOC__019<\/div>","<div>DOC__019<\/div>","<div>DOC__019<\/div>","<div>DOC__020<\/div>","<div>DOC__020<\/div>","<div>DOC__020<\/div>","<div>DOC__021<\/div>","<div>DOC__021<\/div>","<div>DOC__021<\/div>","<div>DOC__022<\/div>","<div>DOC__022<\/div>","<div>DOC__022<\/div>","<div>DOC__023<\/div>","<div>DOC__023<\/div>","<div>DOC__023<\/div>","<div>DOC__024<\/div>","<div>DOC__024<\/div>","<div>DOC__024<\/div>","<div>DOC__025<\/div>","<div>DOC__025<\/div>","<div>DOC__025<\/div>","<div>DOC__026<\/div>","<div>DOC__026<\/div>","<div>DOC__026<\/div>","<div>DOC__027<\/div>","<div>DOC__027<\/div>","<div>DOC__027<\/div>","<div>DOC__028<\/div>","<div>DOC__028<\/div>","<div>DOC__028<\/div>","<div>DOC__029<\/div>","<div>DOC__029<\/div>","<div>DOC__029<\/div>","<div>DOC__030<\/div>","<div>DOC__030<\/div>","<div>DOC__030<\/div>","<div>DOC__031<\/div>","<div>DOC__031<\/div>","<div>DOC__031<\/div>","<div>DOC__032<\/div>","<div>DOC__032<\/div>","<div>DOC__032<\/div>","<div>DOC__033<\/div>","<div>DOC__033<\/div>","<div>DOC__033<\/div>","<div>DOC__034<\/div>","<div>DOC__034<\/div>","<div>DOC__034<\/div>","<div>DOC__035<\/div>","<div>DOC__035<\/div>","<div>DOC__035<\/div>","<div>DOC__036<\/div>","<div>DOC__036<\/div>","<div>DOC__036<\/div>","<div>DOC__037<\/div>","<div>DOC__037<\/div>","<div>DOC__037<\/div>","<div>DOC__038<\/div>","<div>DOC__038<\/div>","<div>DOC__038<\/div>","<div>DOC__039<\/div>","<div>DOC__039<\/div>","<div>DOC__039<\/div>","<div>DOC__040<\/div>","<div>DOC__040<\/div>","<div>DOC__040<\/div>","<div>DOC__041<\/div>","<div>DOC__041<\/div>","<div>DOC__041<\/div>","<div>DOC__042<\/div>","<div>DOC__042<\/div>","<div>DOC__042<\/div>","<div>DOC__043<\/div>","<div>DOC__043<\/div>","<div>DOC__043<\/div>","<div>DOC__044<\/div>","<div>DOC__044<\/div>","<div>DOC__044<\/div>","<div>DOC__045<\/div>","<div>DOC__045<\/div>","<div>DOC__045<\/div>","<div>DOC__046<\/div>","<div>DOC__046<\/div>","<div>DOC__046<\/div>","<div>DOC__047<\/div>","<div>DOC__047<\/div>","<div>DOC__047<\/div>","<div>DOC__048<\/div>","<div>DOC__048<\/div>","<div>DOC__048<\/div>","<div>DOC__049<\/div>","<div>DOC__049<\/div>","<div>DOC__049<\/div>","<div>DOC__050<\/div>","<div>DOC__050<\/div>","<div>DOC__050<\/div>","<div>DOC__051<\/div>","<div>DOC__051<\/div>","<div>DOC__051<\/div>","<div>DOC__052<\/div>","<div>DOC__052<\/div>","<div>DOC__052<\/div>","<div>DOC__053<\/div>","<div>DOC__053<\/div>","<div>DOC__053<\/div>","<div>DOC__054<\/div>","<div>DOC__054<\/div>","<div>DOC__054<\/div>","<div>DOC__055<\/div>","<div>DOC__055<\/div>","<div>DOC__055<\/div>","<div>DOC__056<\/div>","<div>DOC__056<\/div>","<div>DOC__056<\/div>","<div>DOC__057<\/div>","<div>DOC__057<\/div>","<div>DOC__057<\/div>","<div>DOC__058<\/div>","<div>DOC__058<\/div>","<div>DOC__058<\/div>","<div>DOC__059<\/div>","<div>DOC__059<\/div>","<div>DOC__059<\/div>","<div>DOC__060<\/div>","<div>DOC__060<\/div>","<div>DOC__060<\/div>","<div>DOC__061<\/div>","<div>DOC__061<\/div>","<div>DOC__061<\/div>","<div>DOC__062<\/div>","<div>DOC__062<\/div>","<div>DOC__062<\/div>","<div>DOC__063<\/div>","<div>DOC__063<\/div>","<div>DOC__063<\/div>","<div>DOC__064<\/div>","<div>DOC__064<\/div>","<div>DOC__064<\/div>","<div>DOC__065<\/div>","<div>DOC__065<\/div>","<div>DOC__065<\/div>","<div>DOC__066<\/div>","<div>DOC__066<\/div>","<div>DOC__066<\/div>","<div>DOC__067<\/div>","<div>DOC__067<\/div>","<div>DOC__067<\/div>","<div>DOC__068<\/div>","<div>DOC__068<\/div>","<div>DOC__068<\/div>","<div>DOC__069<\/div>","<div>DOC__069<\/div>","<div>DOC__069<\/div>","<div>DOC__070<\/div>","<div>DOC__070<\/
