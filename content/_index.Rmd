This is a proof of concept for an **exciting database website** for the [Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies](https://ochs.org.uk).

Hinduism cannot be understood without the Goddess (Devi/Śakti) and the goddess-oriented Śākta traditions. The Goddess pervades Hinduism at all levels, from aniconic village deities to high-caste pan-Hindu goddesses to esoteric, tantric goddesses.

## How to use
### Viewing in a web browser

<div class="row">
```{block type="col-lg-9 col-md-9 col-sm-6", echo=TRUE}
- One way to use this website is simply as a browsable library, where the user can see texts side-by-side with the original images of the manuscripts
- They can also download the texts and images on the page they're browsing
- And they will be able to comment on the texts or suggest corrections via a comment-only link to a google sheet with the transliteration and translations

```

```{block type="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6", echo=TRUE}
<div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'>
<iframe class='embed-responsive-item featured-work-graphic' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0etTh6FRlw' allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


```

</div>

### Downloading text or images

<div class="row">
```{block type="col-lg-9 col-md-9 col-sm-6", echo=TRUE}
- An important feature that makes this project different to the alternatives out there, such as [GRETIL](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html) or [Muktabodha](https://muktabodha.org) is that we also will provide a public API to the database of the texts and images
- This means that rather than just browsing and downloading individual manuscripts, data science-savvy researcher will be able to programmatically download e.g. all texts or images for manuscripts that meet specific criteria


```

```{block type="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6", echo=TRUE}
<div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'>
